------------------------------------------

Time: 30 minutes
Servings: 6

Ingredients:
2 heads cauliflower
1 medium onion
4 cloves garlic
1 pound whole-wheat pasta
Extra-virgin olive oil
Salt and pepper
1 pinch red pepper flakes
White wine vinegar
1/2 lemon
1/2 cup toasted walnuts
4 ounces ricotta salata or feta cheese

3. Peel the onion and slice it very thin.
4. Peel and finely chop the garlic.
5. Put the pasta on to cook.
6. Saute the cauliflower in olive oil in a large saute pan.
7. When the cauliflower begins to soften, season with salt and pepper and add the sliced onion and red pepper flakes.
8. Saute over medium to high heat until the vegetables are brown and tender.
9. Add the garlic and remove from the heat, tossing and stirring so the garlic doesnâ€™t burn.
10. Add a few drops each of vinegar and lemon juice and the toasted walnuts.
11. When the pasta is done, drain and add to the cauliflower, adding enough olive oil to coat the pasta thoroughly.
12. Toss together and serve, with the cheese crumbled over the dish.
